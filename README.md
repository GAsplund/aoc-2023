# Advent of Code 2023

This is my personal repo for AoC 2023.
This year, my challenge will be to have every solution available in the browser using WASM.
As a learning experience, I will use Rust for the solutions.

Also, check out my [previous year](https://github.com/GAsplund/aoc-2022) where I did the polyglot challenge.
